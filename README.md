- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Roger! 
- **** Below is an updated intro, will be further revised later...***
- Iâ€™m beyond other things interested in microcontrollers, systems and tools for fighting global warming.
SW tools are Arduino, C++, Python, etc and some HW 
Skilled by 22 years as a system engineeer at FOI, Sweden, mainly developing and testing RF intellignce collecting systems. Today I'm retiered and busy doing the above and everything giving meaning to life.
- ðŸŒ± Current tech interests are Arduino, SW tools, Apps for ios and maybe Java and how to design/integrate SW and HW for power conversion, BMSes, EV, solarPanels, grid interfaces, IT-tools, CANbus etc...
- I have access to a 2012 Kangoo ZE, some 80 LiFePO4 15A cells and I suspect, half a Kia Omega 10kWh Hybride battery system intended to be used as a battery pack controlled over CANbus.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on all the above!
-  currently aware of the need to improve CanZE to Kangoo ZE!
-  Always ready to learn and cooperate when suitable!
