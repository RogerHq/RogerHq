- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RogerHq
- Iâ€™m beyond other things interested in microcontrollers, solar panel systems and 
fighting global warming.
My tools are Arduino, C++, Python, HW development and 22 years as a system
engineeer at FOI, Swedish Defence Research Facility in LinkÃ¶ping. Now I'm retiered and
busy doing different things as usual.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning arduino, ESP32, somePython and how to design power conversion modules for solar panels etc...
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on all the above!
